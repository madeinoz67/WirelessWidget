The examples/ directory contains a few examples that will help you get
started with Contiki.

To run the example programs, you need either to be running Linux or
FreeBSD (or any other *nix-type system), or install Cygwin if you are
running Microsoft Windows (http://www.cygwin.com/). As a minimum you
will need to have the gcc C compiler installed. To run the examples in
the 'netsim' target, you need to have GTK 1.x development libraries
installed. These are usually called 'gtk-devel', 'libgtk1-devel' or
similar in your Linux software installation programs.

hello-world/

  A really simple Contiki program that shows how to write Contiki
  programs. To compile and test the program, go into the hello-world
  directory:

    cd examples/hello-world

  Run the 'make' command.

    make

  This will compile the hello-world program in the 'rfm12widgetboard' target.
  This causes the entire Contiki operating system and the hello-world
  application to be compiled into a single program that can be uploaded to the widget board by
  typing the following command:

    make hello-world.u

  This will upload and program the widgetboard and then print out on the serial console:

    Contiki initiated, now starting process scheduling
    Hello, world

blinky/

  A really simple Contiki program that shows how to write Contiki
  programs. To compile and test the program, go into the blinky
  directory:

    cd examples/blinky

  Run the 'make' command.

    make

  This will compile the hello-world program in the 'rfm12widgetboard' target.
  This causes the entire Contiki operating system and the blinky
  application to be compiled and uploaded to the widgetboard by
  typing the following command:

    make blinky.u

  This will print out the following text:


   Is there anybody out there?

   ********BOOTING RFM12Widget*********
   System online.
   There is!
   There is!
   There is!
   There is!
   There is!
   There is!

  Each time "There is!" is printed the onboard leds will toggle on or off at approx 1Hz
