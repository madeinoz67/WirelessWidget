- Changes to RFM12Demo.pde to flash Green Led on RFM12WidgetBoard on successful Receive of packet (checksums ok)

2009-06-04 jcw
- Made v2 protocol the default, i.e. crc includes group. Incompatible with v1!
- Cleanups, remove some recent new ack code which won't be used after all.

2009-05-17 jcw
- Added new rf12_recvAcked() code to take care of ack-sending as 0-byte reply.
- Added new rf12_sleep() to manage RF12 power-down, with optional wakeup period.

2009-05-07 jcw
- Added first basic version of the new streaming I/O layer as "RF12sio.{h,c}".
- Added rf12serial and rf12stream demo sketches to the RF12 library.

2009-05-06 jcw
- Changed the default group to 0xD4, other values only supported by RFM12B's.
- Extended the RF12demo into a general RF12 EEPROM configuration utility.
- Added rf12_config() to initialize the RF12 hardware from settings in EEPROM.
- Added $Id comment lines to all source files so filenames are shown in files.

2009-04-16 jcw
- Added support for v2 protocol, with group added to crc and default group 0x51.
- Removed rf12_group(), it's now an optional arg of rf12_initialize() instead.

2009-03-22 jcw
- Added README to "RF12demo" sketch with instructions on how to run some tests.
- Added rf12_group() to allow changing the group from 0x50 to something else.

2009-03-16 jcw
- Extended RF12demo to also configure frequency band, not just the node id.

2009-02-23 jcw
- Regression fixed, failed to set up ack sending with proper source node id.

2009-02-21 jcw
- Changed rf12_initialize() args to node ID plus one of 3 frequency band codes.
- Added rf12_onOff() for OOK emulation (must initialize with node ID zero).
- Added new "fs20demo" example to control FS20 devices from the RFM12B.
- Added new "kaku_demo" example to control KlikAanKlikUit devices at 433 MHz.
- Replace EEPROM.h in "RF12.cpp" with eeprom_*() calls in "RF12demo.pde".

2009-02-16 jcw
- Subversion repository moved to Google code.

2009-02-10 jcw
- Comments added to RF12.h to describe each public function.
- Made rf12_recvStart() private, this is handled by rf12_recvDone().
- Replace ISR(INT0_vect) by call to attachInterrupt() to avoid duplicate
  definition error. Code now also works with Arduino-0013.

2009-02-09 jcw
- Public release.
