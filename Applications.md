# Introduction #
The Strobit Wireless Widget was designed to be Arduino Compatible, so as to maximise existing code development tool chains and libraries.

Currently there have been no applications specifically written for the Strobit Wireless Widget but the links below are a great starting point.

Jean-Claude has created a fantastic and well implemented home sensor network based on the Arduino and the RFM12B, he has created an Arduino RFM12 Library (as well as a host of other sensor drivers) for the Arduino and a monitoring application to tie everything together.
