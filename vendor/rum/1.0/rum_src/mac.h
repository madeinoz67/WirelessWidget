   The RUM MAC is a quasi-compliant 802.15.4 MAC layer.  It provides
   access to basic radio setup functions for channel, power, etc.
   Also, the MAC provides functions to scan all channels for a
   coordinator, associate with a coordinator, send packets, and
   receive packets via callback functions.

   @subsection dataframe Data Frame 

   This is the format for a data frame, but the format is similar to

/**
    @brief NODETYPE is defined to be one of the three basic node
    types: coordinator, router, or end node.

    This definition is used widely throughout the code to define the
    different behavior for the different types of nodes. For example,
    there are many places in the code that look like this:

    @code
    if (NODETYPE == COORD)
    {
      // Do something only the coordinator would do.
    }
    @endcode

    This comparison causes the compiler to optimize away the code
    inside the brackets for a router or end node, which saves on flash
    space.

    To define the NODETYPE variable, define one of the following
    variables (as one) in the Makefile or AVR Studio project setting.

    - COORDNODE
    - ROUTER
    - ENDNODE
