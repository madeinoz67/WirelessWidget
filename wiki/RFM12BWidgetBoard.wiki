=Features=
  * low profile 0603 SMD design.
  * Compact board, 30mm x 70mm. (without battery)
  * Low component count (K.I.S.S.) easy to assemble with minimal SMD soldering.
  * 3V design non regulated (no on board regulator).
  * Different power source options
  * Reverse polarity protected.
    * USB and battery can both be connected at the same time. Schottky diode protected. Can be bypassed via solder jumpers if required. 
  * Low profile high stability ceramic oscillator.
  * Onboard on/off switch to save batteries when not in use, can be bypassed if not required.  Remote switch can utilise the PCB contacts if required.
  * FTDI 3.3v breakout cable port for connecting to either RS232 TTL or USB using the FTDI cable.
  * Atmega168V or Atmega328P processor, low cost, low voltage design = longer battery life.  Can use standard Atmega168 if low voltage not required.
  * Can run Arduino Lilypad bootloader.
  * External SMA antenna for reliability and extended range.
  * Low cost RFM12B RF module by [http://www.hoperf.com/ HopeRF]
  * x2 onboard LEDs for indication, I/O can be reused if LEDs are not required.
  * Side mounted SMA antenna, designed to allow folding of antenna along the axis of the PCB in the event the PCB/enclosure needs to be stored.
  * Variety of antenna options

=Power Options=
*NOTE: This board is unregulated and designed to run from a 3v battery source*
  * x2 AA Alkaline via external power connector.
  * CR123A 3V battery using optional built-in battery holder.
  * Host powered via FTDI-3.3USB connector.
  * Via Personality board interconnects VBAT and +3V.

=Radio Module=
   The RF module used by this widget is the RFM12B by [HopeRF http://www.hoperf.com/pro/RFM12B.html].  This is a low cost, low power module available in 433Mhz, 868Mhz and 916Mhz bands. 
 
==Antenna Options==
  * SMA PCB mount
  * SMA pigtail soldered onto PCB
  * Whip antenna soldered directly onto board (piece of correct length wire)

=Software=
    * Compatible with [http://arduino.cc/ Arduino] development environment.  
    * Select 'LilyPad' as the target board
    * RFM12B drivers for the Arduino can be obtained from [http://code.google.com/p/jeelab/wiki/RF12 JeeLab] and is compatible with the current hardware.
    * Arduino [http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage Tutorials] and Applications written are compatible with the Strobit Wireless Widget.
