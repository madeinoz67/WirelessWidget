==Goal==
The goal of this sub project is to provide simple mesh networking for the widgets.  Something along the lines of a cutdown Zigbee/SP100a stack.

Some of the features I'm hoping to implement:
 * Frequency hopping to give diversity to interference.
 * TDMA type access to media. Allow contention free access to RF for all nodes in the network.
 * Basic Meshing, extending the range of sensor, routing of packets over alternate routes if nodes fail etc
 * Remote firmware updates.
