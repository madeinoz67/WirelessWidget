=Design Questions Answered=

Q.  the pins on the headers don't line up, are they special components?

A.  Don't worry, they are standard SIL headers, I've used the Sparkfun library for this part and used their 'LOCK' version of the footprints, more information here: [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=114]  they work very well, in fact I used them to temporarily put male SIL headers in place so I could put the Wireless Widget board on a breadboard.  I could then program the boot loaders, the tension provides good contact with the pins, when I finished playing around I could remove the headers and eventually solder in the correct female headers when they arrived.

Q. Why is the SMA antenna on the side and not at the front of the board?  

A. I designed the board so that it could be stored with the antenna still on, just folding along the axis of the board. i.e. like putting it into a camera bag.

Q.  What is D1 for?  Do I need it?

A.  D1 is a schottky protection diode used for two things:
    # Reverse battery protection, so if you put the battery or power the wrong way around it won't kill the board.
    # the second is so that the FTDI cable can be connected without removing the battery.  It blocks either power source from getting back to the other.  If you have both the battery and the FTDI cable connected without D1, the batteries will try and charge and probably draw more current, heat up and die a horrible death.  (actually they get very hot and let smoke out and smell a lot - believe me, I talk from experience)

D1 can be disabled (at your own risk) by either not installing it and using the solder jumpers document below to bypass it.

==Other sources==
What I did while waiting for my components to come in was to salvage SMD components from old motherboards, this is a good source for bypass capacitors(C1,C2,C3,C4)and Ferrite Beads(L1). It allowed me to get a minimal board up and running so I could test things.

Ferrite beads can be found around the USB and ethernet ports, Ususally labelled with FB, B or L. 

One of the things with this is that many of these are 0804 parts, while the Wireless Widget is 0603, this is not a big problem, by turning the 0804 parts on their side they will fit ok.

=Surface Mount Soldering=
I actually find making SMD boards way easier than the old PTH components method.  For small boards such as this it does not take long at all.

There are a few of ways to do this:

  # Hand Soldering
  # Hotplate/Skillet plate
  # Toaster Oven

 [Sparkfuns SMD Solder Tutorials http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=36]

 ==Tools==
You are going to need a few tools regardless of what method you use.

These are what I currently use:
  * Right angle tweezers.
  * Jewellers Loupe or magnifying glass.
  * soldering Iron with a fine tip
  * Solder
  * De-Solder Wick
  * Solder Paste in syringe.
  * SMD component storage containers with spring lids.
  * Multimeter
  * Temperature probe capable of going to 250DegC

Most of these tools I purchased from [http://www.dealextreme.com]  (WARNING: This site is very addictive).  I also get my SMA connectors, pigtails and 900MHZ antennas here.  shipping is free worldwide, and their prices are fantastic.

At the moment I don't use a solder paste mask I apply it all by hand the first couple of boards I used a little too much solder and had some bridges I needed to remove, however after the 3rd board I don't have any solder bridges and I have a good idea of how much solder paste I need to apply. Actually very little solder paste actually is needed on most components, the only one that needs a bit more is the RFM12B transceiver, all the rest is but a smear on the pad, which causes a nice fillet on the finished joints.

  ==The steps I use - (Toaster Oven)==
   # Make sure you have all the correct components, I usually place mine into labelled SMD storage containers before I start.  It make it things much easier when I'm placing them. 
   # Clean the PCB with cleaning alcohol and wipe dry with a paper towel.
   # Apply solder paste to all components all that you're installing, only small amounts are needed.
   # Apply solder paste to the jumpers you want to close, put a generous amount on these, try and cover the two pads, these will flow to form a bridge.
   # Using the tweezers place the components onto the their respective pads (using the layout picture above as a guide)  Be careful with polarised components, these are C7, U1, RFM12, LED1 and LED2, they can easily be put the wrong way around.  (TODO: Pictures)
   # I test my LEDS before I place them as they are very small and hard to work out which end is the cathode.  I use my multimeter on continuity/resistor setting and put them directly on each end of the LED, if the LED lights up, then the end I have my red test lead on goes towards R2 and R3 on the board. 
  # once All components are placed and I've tripple checked that I have them all the right way around (It's much harder to change them after they are soldered) I then place them in my toaster oven with it turned off.
  # I've modified my toaster oven my adding a PID Ramp controller, this allows me to have the SMD solder temperature profiles programmed in, I just hit go and it does the rest by setting the correct temperatures and wait times, but most of you will not have this luxury.  What I suggest is to familiarise yourself with the solders temperature profile, available from the manufactures website.
