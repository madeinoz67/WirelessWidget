#summary This page outlines different options for the device's form factor and external connections.

= Introduction =

I think it is a good idea to make the device as flexible as possible. Ideally we'd never need any hardware changes to the device once it's done. This way we would be able to get it approved by, say, FCC, and use it guilt-free :)

I think a device should have the following:

 * wireless interface
 * two ports for external peripherals (described later)
 * USB port for setup and firmware update
 * several LEDs
 * buzzer

Additionally it would be good to have an alternative version with a display and some keys. I think this _configurator_ device would be useful to pass settings to other devices. Besides it could be made bigger to put in pocket and never use in actual triggering.


= Details =

I propose to put the strobit device into a box approximately 100mm x 50mm x 35mm. On one side we would put the antenna, and on the other side two connectors.

I suggest adding two 6-pin connectors to hook up flashes and cameras. The 6-pin mini-DIN connector (also used as PS/2 mouse/keyboard connector) is a rather common connector and can easily be salvaged from old motherboards. The other part can be salvaged from old mice/keyboards.

With 6 pins we are able to supply power and ground as well as 4 i/o lines.

A port can be used as output to light flashes. Another option is to remotely trigger a camera.

Secondly, a port can be used as input. This includes getting the trigger signal from camera but also from different devices like accoustic trigger or laser detector.

So every piece of external hardware gets connected to the 6-pin port with a special cable. When a new piece of hardware needs to be connected there's no need to change the original hardware, just design new cable.


I've put together this little sketch of how a device can be attached to a camera.
