#summary Introducing the Strobit Wireless Widget

= Introduction =

A hardware and software project for Strobists and Geeks alike.

This project aims to build a "hackable" wireless platform that can be used for a number of projects, e.g. for off camera lighting, aka "The Strobist Effect" http://www.strobist.com/. This platform is open in terms of hardware, software and protocols, so you can implement whatever functions you like.

It aims to be more reliable than the 'Ebay Triggers' and cheaper than the commercial Pocket Wizards.

The other great thing is the Strobit hardware also doubles as a great little Arduino based "Wireless Widget" for non Strobist activity such as home control, wireless sensor etc.

As its Arduino based, there is plenty of Open libraries and tools to support it.
